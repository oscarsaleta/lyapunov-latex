\begin{abstract}
The study of singular points of planar systems of differential equations in order to distinguish weak foci from centers often requires the computation of Lyapunov constants, which is a complex problem, proven hard to tackle even for powerful modern computers.

In this work, we will introduce a parallelization tool and a new set of operations that act on polynomials as if they were vectors. These tools, allow us to take a first step towards solving the problem of characterising the centers of polynomial systems with three monomial nonlinearities. In the last chapter, we provide preliminary results in this direction, studying the homogeneous and non homogeneous cases of degree 3 in which the first monomial is non resonant.
